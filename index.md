# Math can be fun.

Although functions are enjoyed by programmers and mathematicians alike, finding the fun in functions can be daunting for many. When you make a mistake in programming you get a helpful error message that is useful in solving the problem. Only in math, a mistake is followed by a lot of *confusion*. It **does not** have to be. A mistake is a chance to rethink the math in front of you and work on understanding it fully. In this class a million mistakes is allowed. We will strive to master mathematical concepts and address our misconceptions.
